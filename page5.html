      <p><p class="sev">THE SYMPHONY OF STONES</p> or the "Khosrov Forest Field," is an absolutely unique place in Armenia where the stones and nature seem to create music together. It is here, near the Khosrov Forest, that one can hear the rhythmic vibrations of stones, which, according to studies, are caused by seismic activity and environmental changes. This natural "symphony" creates a harmonious contrast, which is still not fully understood. It holds not only musical but also restorative significance for nature.The Garni Gorge is situated 23.3 kilometres (14.5 mi) east of Yerevan, Armenia, just below the village of the same name. The Garni Gorge is protected by law and listed as a natural monument.[1] On a promontory above the gorge the first-century AD Temple of Garni may be seen. Before Armenia converted to Christianity in 301 AD, Greek gods were worshipped at this temple.[2] Along the sides of the gorge are cliff walls of well-preserved basalt columns, carved out by the Goght River. This portion of the Garni Gorge is typically referred to as the "Symphony of the Stones." It is most easily reached via a road that leads left down the gorge just before reaching the temple of Garni. Another road leads to the gorge through the village, down a cobblestone road, and into the valley. Once in the valley, turning right will lead to Garni Gorge, an 11th-century medieval bridge, and the "Symphony of the Stones". Taking a left will lead along the river past a fish hatchery, up to the Khosrov Forest State Reserve, and a little further Havuts Tar Monastery.

      The ancient Geghard Monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is also within walking distance. Partially carved into the mountain, the monastery has existed since the fourth century AD. The main cathedral was built much later, in the thirteenth century.The Symphony of Stones is a natural formation of basalt columns that were formed millions of years ago during volcanic activity. Here’s how it happened:

      Volcanic Eruptions: Around 25–30 million years ago (during the Cenozoic era), intense volcanic activity occurred in the region.
      
      Cooling of Lava: As the hot basaltic lava cooled rapidly, it contracted and cracked. These cracks propagated downwards, creating hexagonal (six-sided) and pentagonal (five-sided) columns.
      
      Perfect Columns: Due to uniform cooling rates, the basalt columns formed vertically, creating the illusion of a giant, man-made organ or a symphonic musical instrument made of stone.
      
      Natural Erosion: Over millions of years, natural forces like water, wind, and temperature shifts sculpted and exposed the columns, making them even more dramatic and accessible.
      
      The result: a magnificent natural wall of tall, regular, pipe-like stone columns rising along the sides of the Garni Gorge, resembling the pipes of a grand organ.The name "Symphony of Stones" beautifully captures both the visual and symbolic essence:

      Symphony represents harmony, music, and rhythm — much like the geometric order and flow of the stone columns.
      
      Stones refer to the solid, ancient, enduring nature of the basalt.
      
      Many visitors and locals feel that the sight of the stones, with their majestic vertical rhythm, evokes the idea of nature composing a silent, eternal symphony.Height: Some columns reach heights of 50 meters (164 feet) or more.

      Shape: Mostly hexagonal, but some are five- or seven-sided.
      
      Material: Solid basalt rock.
      
      Appearance: Dark gray to black in color, with striking, repeating patterns.
      
      Size: The entire formation stretches along a significant portion of the Garni Gorge.
      
      When seen from a distance, the rocks look almost perfectly chiseled, as if crafted by a giant stone mason.Geology: The formation is an excellent example of columnar jointing in basalt, studied by geologists worldwide.

      Educational Value: Geologists use it to explain volcanic activity, cooling patterns of lava, and natural erosion.
      
      Conservation: The site is considered a protected natural monument under Armenian law.Tourism: Thousands of tourists visit every year as part of tours to Garni Temple and Geghard Monastery.

      National Pride: The Symphony of Stones is a source of pride for Armenians, representing the power and artistry of their natural landscape.
      
      Photography: It's a favorite spot for photographers because of the surreal patterns, lighting, and the river below.
      
      Some believe that the stones carry an almost mystical energy, inspiring awe, reflection, and creativity.Similar basalt column formations exist in other parts of the world (e.g., Giant’s Causeway in Northern Ireland, Devils Postpile in the USA, and Fingal’s Cave in Scotland), but Armenia’s Symphony of Stones is unique for its dramatic scale and wild natural setting.

      The stones often appear in Armenian literature, art, and music as symbols of natural beauty and endurance.Spring to Autumn (April–October) is the best time.

      In spring, the surrounding gorge is lush and green, creating a stunning contrast against the dark basalt.
      
      In winter, the area can be covered in snow, giving the columns a magical, otherworldly appearance.</p>
