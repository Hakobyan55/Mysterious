        Translation: "Tsak" = hole or pierced | "Qar" = stone
        English meaning: "Pierced Stone" or "Hole Stone"
        Location: Near the village of Hatsik, Shirak Province, Armenia
        Elevation: ~1,700 meters above sea level
        Cultural Type: Natural and possibly spiritual monument
        
         Geographic and Natural Context
        Tsak Qar is located in the vicinity of Hatsik (’Ä’°÷Å’´’Ø) village, in the northwestern Shirak Marz, not far from the city of Gyumri.
        
        The area is part of the Shirak Plateau, a high-altitude volcanic plain with:
        
        Rich basalt and tuff rock formations
        
        Cold winters and dry, breezy summers
        
        Natural springs and grazing fields
        
        Tsak Qar itself is a large volcanic boulder or monolith with a naturally formed hole through its center ‚Äî a geological curiosity and spiritual symbol.
        
         Folklore and Cultural Beliefs
        Tsak Qar is deeply rooted in Armenian village folklore. It‚Äôs not just a rock, but a place of ancient tradition, rituals, and local legends. Common beliefs include:
        
         Healing and Fertility Site
        Locals, especially women, believe that passing through the hole in the stone brings:
        
        Health
        
        Fertility
        
        Protection from evil
        
        Even today, villagers may visit the stone on holy days, praying before or after crawling through the opening.
        
         Wish Stone
        The rock is believed to grant wishes to those who:
        
        Walk around it three times
        
        Whisper a wish
        
        Pass through the hole without touching the sides
        
         Ancient Pagan or Christian Shrine
        Some historians and villagers think Tsak Qar may have been a pre-Christian ritual site, later adapted into local Christian practices.
        
        It‚Äôs often visited on holidays like Vardavar, Ascension Day, and Saints‚Äô Feast Days.

        It may date back to pre-Christian times (before 301 AD), possibly used for pagan rituals.
        
        Similar ‚Äúsacred stones with holes‚Äù exist across Armenia and the Caucasus, often near ancient settlement sites or burial grounds.
