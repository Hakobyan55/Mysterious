      <p><p class="sev">PEMZASHEN CHURCH</p> Pemzashen Church – A Hidden Jewel of Armenian Heritage
        Location: Village of Pemzashen, Shirak Province, Armenia
        Founded: 7th Century (600s AD)
        Religious Affiliation: Armenian Apostolic Church
        Style: Early Medieval Armenian Architecture
        Status: Partially preserved, historical monument

        The church at Pemzashen has a small cruciform central-plan with a single intact octagonal drum above. Four small windows are located around the drum. The dome that once stood above has since collapsed, but the geometric cornice directly under where it stood is still intact. A side chapel is attached to the main church with a separate entry directly adjacent to the main portal to the church. Upon the lintel to the main entry to the church is a carving of the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus in her arms, and an angel to either side descending to Mary with child holding a cloth in their arms. Mary is flanked by two other figures with gifts in their hands. The angel and figure to the right have been defaced almost completely except for the angel's cloth, and the faces of all of the remaining figures have been defaced as well except for the figure standing to the right. The rear façades of the church and chapel are partially in ruin, and at one time there had been other rooms attached to the front façade of the structure, as is evident from the remnants of collapsed walls.
        
         Geographic Context
        Pemzashen Church is located in the village of Pemzashen, which lies in the northwestern Shirak Province, near the town of Artik. The region is known for:
        
        High elevation terrain on the Shirak volcanic plateau (~1,850 meters above sea level)
        
        Volcanic tuff stone quarries, giving local churches their distinctive red and black coloring
        
        Cold, snowy winters and mild summers
        
        Proximity to other cultural monuments such as Harichavank Monastery and Lmbatavank
        
         Historical Background
        The church was built in the 7th century, during a time when Armenia was developing its own unique school of Christian architecture after adopting Christianity in 301 AD.
        
        It is believed to have been commissioned by local nobles, possibly the Kamsarakan family, known patrons of Armenian religious architecture.
        
        Pemzashen village itself has ancient roots, with nearby archaeological remains including early fortress ruins, pagan shrines, and medieval cemeteries.
        
         Architectural Features
         Plan & Structure
        Built in a single-nave basilica style with:
        
        A semicircular apse on the eastern end
        
        Two side chambers flanking the apse (commonly used as vestries)
        
        The church likely had a wooden or stone vaulted roof, though it no longer survives.
        
         Materials
        Constructed with reddish volcanic tuff stone, common to Shirak.
        
        Walls are thick and built to withstand both time and Armenia's seismic activity.
        
         Details
        Windows are narrow slits, designed to let in light while preserving the stability of the thick walls.
        
        Decorative elements are modest, in keeping with early medieval Armenian simplicity.
        
        Doorway has a traditional Armenian cross carved above it, now weathered.
        
        Interior was possibly plastered and painted, though no full frescoes survive.
        
         Current Condition
        The church is in partial ruin:
        
        The roof has collapsed
        
        Some walls are missing or damaged
        
        Foundations and part of the apse remain intact
        
        Despite this, the floor plan is still visible, and many stones are in their original position.
        
        Preservation status:
        
        Registered as a historical-cultural monument of Armenia
        
        Occasionally visited by archaeologists, architecture students, and tourists
        
        No active restoration as of now, but it's monitored by heritage authorities
        
         Cultural and Spiritual Significance
        The church was once the religious heart of Pemzashen village, hosting:
        
        Baptisms
        
        Weddings
        
        Feast day celebrations
        
        Even in its ruined state, villagers sometimes gather around the site on major religious holidays.
        
        Pemzashen Church symbolizes the spiritual endurance of the Armenian people, surviving centuries of:
        
        Foreign invasions
        
        Earthquakes
        
        Soviet-era neglect
        
         Legends and Folklore
        Locals believe:
        
        The church’s cold stones “hold the prayers of centuries”
        
        A hidden passage once connected the church to nearby springs or hills for protection during invasions
        
        It was a site of miracles, especially for women praying for children
        
        Such legends enhance the mystique and reverence felt by villagers and visitors.
        
         Tourism and Accessibility
         Getting There:
        From Gyumri: ~35-minute drive (around 25 km)
        
        From Yerevan: ~2.5 hours by car
        
         What to See:
        Ruins of the church in a quiet field with dramatic views of Mount Aragats
        
        Nearby ruins of other churches and cross-stones (khachkars)
        
        The peaceful, untouched countryside, perfect for photography and meditation
        
         Tips:
        Wear sturdy shoes; the site is rocky and uneven
        
        No entrance fee – open access
        
        Best visited in late spring or early autumn
        
        Respect the site – no climbing on ruins or littering
        
         Did You Know?
        "Pemzashen" means “Village of Tuff” – named after the volcanic rock used in construction.
        
        The church survived many earthquakes, especially the devastating Spitak earthquake of 1988, with partial damage.
        
        It is included in studies of 7th-century Armenian religious architecture alongside famous sites like Zvartnots and Talin Cathedral.
        
         Conclusion
        Though modest and partly ruined, Pemzashen Church is a powerful example of Armenia’s early Christian identity, rural resilience, and sacred architecture. It is one of the countless lesser-known treasures of Armenia that deserve attention and preservation.</p>
