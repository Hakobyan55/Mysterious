         Location and Geography
        Sarnaghbyur (Սառնաղբյուր) is a village situated in the northwestern part of Armenia, within the Shirak Province, one of the coldest regions in the country.
        
        The village is located about 10 kilometers southeast of Gyumri, the second-largest city in Armenia, and the provincial capital of Shirak.
        
        It sits at an elevation of approximately 1,700 meters (5,577 feet) above sea level.
        
        The terrain is mountainous and hilly, typical of the Shirak Plateau, with vast open fields and a continental highland climate — cold, snowy winters and mild summers.
        
         Name and Meaning
        “Sarnaghbyur” literally translates from Armenian as “Cold Spring” (սառը = sar = cold, աղբյուր = aghbyur = spring/fountain), referencing the natural cold water springs in the area.
        
        The name reflects the village’s fresh, clean water sources, which are important to its identity and agriculture.
        
         Population and Demographics
        As of the 2011 Armenian Census, the population was approximately 2,000 residents.
        
        Most of the villagers are ethnic Armenians, and the predominant language is Armenian.
        
        The majority of the population is Christian, primarily followers of the Armenian Apostolic Church.
        
         History and Heritage
        Sarnaghbyur has ancient roots, with historical connections dating back centuries. The area has been inhabited since early Armenian history.
        
        The village is near regions affected by major historical events like the Armenian Genocide, World War I, and the Soviet era.
        
        It was part of the Armenian SSR during the Soviet Union, and agriculture was collectivized during that time.
        
        After Armenia gained independence in 1991, the village remained largely rural but saw some development.
        
         Churches and Cultural Sites
        The St. Sarkis Church (Սուրբ Սարգիս եկեղեցի), built in the 19th century, is one of the notable religious landmarks.
        
        There are traditional Armenian khachkars (cross-stones) and cemeteries in and around the village, reflecting centuries of Christian heritage.
        
         Economy and Livelihood
        The economy is primarily based on agriculture and animal husbandry.
        
        People grow wheat, barley, potatoes, and keep cattle and sheep.
        
        Due to the region’s fertile soil and cold springs, Sarnaghbyur is good for crop cultivation and pasture-based farming.
        
        Many residents also work in Gyumri or even abroad, sending remittances back home.
